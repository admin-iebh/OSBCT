"""Does the LIVE SITE serve what this working copy says it should?

WHY THIS EXISTS.  Every other gate reads the repository.  Not one of them looks
at what a visitor actually receives, and in three days that gap produced four
separate incidents:

  * 2026-07-30f  `/reader/reader.html` served the RETIRED reader for hours after
                 the stub was deployed — a stale edge object, mis-diagnosed
                 twice before a deploy cleared it.
  * 2026-07-30g  a cached `i18n.js` against new HTML would have printed raw keys
                 (`tip_toc`) as tooltips on screen.
  * 2026-07-30h  `osbct.buddha-dhamma.net` returned GitHub's own 404 — a cited
                 URL broken rather than moved — while this file recorded it as
                 redirecting.
  * 2026-07-30i  the whole site was fine and 3,774 cross-references still landed
                 on the wrong page, because a derived file was eight days old.
                 (`check_derived.py` guards that one now, before the push.)

Each was found by hand, late, and each cost an hour or more.

WHAT IT CHECKS, and the one idea worth keeping: every URL is fetched TWICE —
bare, which is what a visitor gets, and again with a unique query string, which
misses any edge cache and so reaches the origin.  **If the two differ, the edge
is serving something the origin no longer has**, which is precisely the failure
of 2026-07-30f and is invisible to any check that fetches once.

  * every published page carries the BUILD this working copy stamped
  * key data files are byte-identical to the local ones (sha1)
  * `/reader/reader.html` is the retirement stub, not the old reader
  * the `osbct.` hostname still 301s to the apex — Zenodo and CITATION.cff
    depend on it and GitHub Pages does NOT do this for you
  * bare == cache-busted, for all of the above

Run it AFTER pushing.  A push is not a deploy; GitHub Pages takes a minute or
two, so a failure immediately after pushing may only mean "not yet".  Re-run.

Usage:
  python3 pipeline/verify_live.py [--origin https://buddha-dhamma.net]
