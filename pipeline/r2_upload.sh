# Upload the dictionary stores to the Cloudflare R2 bucket.
#
# WRITTEN 2026-08-07 for the D+B decision in docs/DEPLOY_SCALE.md 6a.  Run by
# the reader, on his own machine, with his own credentials.  NOTHING in this
# file contains a secret and nothing in it should ever be made to: rclone holds
# the credentials in its own config, which is the point.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT THIS DOES *NOT* DO, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE
#
# It does not move, delete or rewrite a single file in the repository.  At the
# point this script runs, `site/lookup/` and `site/lookup_eval/` are exactly
# where they have always been and Pages is still publishing them.  This is a
# COPY to a second place, so that the second place can be tested before
# anything depends on it.  The relocation is step 4 of 6a and comes later.
#
# Re-running is cheap and is the intended way to update a dictionary:
# `--checksum` sends only what actually changed.  That is the answer to "can we
# update the dictionaries?" -- an update becomes a sync to the bucket plus a
# repo commit, and the Pages deploy never sees it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ONE-TIME SETUP, BY HAND, BEFORE THE FIRST RUN
#
#   1. Create the R2 bucket in the Cloudflare dashboard.
#   2. Bind a custom domain to it (working name: dict.buddha-dhamma.net).
#      A custom domain, not the r2.dev development URL -- r2.dev is rate
#      limited and not meant to be depended on.
#   3. Apply the CORS policy in `pipeline/r2_cors.json`.  dict.<domain> is a
#      DIFFERENT ORIGIN from <domain>, so without this every fetch fails and
#      the dictionary panel is silently empty.
#   4. `rclone config` -- new remote, type `s3`, provider `Cloudflare`,
#      endpoint `https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`, and an R2 API
#      token with Object Read & Write.  Name the remote `osbct-r2`.
#   5. Set BUCKET below, then run this script from the repository root.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE CONTENT-TYPE DECISION, WHICH IS THE WHOLE RISK -- see DEPLOY_SCALE 6b
#
# `jfetch` (site/reader/panel.js:499) sniffs the gzip magic bytes because a
# `.gz` can arrive EITHER as opaque compressed bytes (host sets no
# Content-Encoding, panel inflates it itself) OR already inflated by the
# browser (host sets `Content-Encoding: gzip`).  Both branches exist; only one
# runs, and which one is the HOST's choice.
#
# This script deliberately chooses the OPAQUE form -- `application/gzip`, no
# `Content-Encoding` -- because that is what GitHub Pages does today and what
# is therefore already proven in production.  Changing the origin and the
# encoding semantics in the same step would mean a failure could be either.
#
# If you change this, you are changing which branch of `jfetch` runs in
# production, and `pipeline/check_r2_origin.js` must be re-run.  Do not change
# it casually and do not change it at the same time as anything else.

# !!! THE SOURCE OF TRUTH IS `git ls-files`, NOT THE FILESYSTEM.
#
# CORRECTED 2026-08-07, AFTER THIS SCRIPT SHIPPED THE BUG IT WAS WARNED ABOUT.
# The first version walked the directory with --include globs.  That uploaded
# 11,229 files that are DELIBERATELY GITIGNORED: `site/lookup_eval/dpd/*.json`,
# the uncompressed originals kept locally so a rebuild need not start from
# nothing.  Only the `.gz` is tracked and only the `.gz` is ever fetched --
# `index.json` lists `dpd` in its `gz` array, so the panel never asks for them.
#
# lookup_eval landed 28,509 objects against 17,280 tracked.  28,509 is exactly
# the count on disk.  DEPLOY_SCALE 1a states this hazard in as many words --
# "measuring the working tree counts 11,229 files and ~360 MB that are never
# deployed" -- and this script was written after that sentence and walked into
# it anyway.  The count check below is what caught it.
#
# So every pass is now driven by a FILE LIST derived from git, and the
# filesystem is only ever read for the bytes of files git already named.  What
# Pages publishes and what the bucket serves are then the same set by
# construction rather than by coincidence.
#
# Three passes still, because the content type differs per kind and rclone
# applies --header-upload to everything it touches in one run.
