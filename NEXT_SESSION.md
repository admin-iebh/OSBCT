## What happened on 2026-08-26 — one day, in order

1. **`19Khu02 → 27KhuA08`, 437 links** moved off the commentary's reprint and
   onto the comment. Gated red first, four printed pages read.
2. **The worksheet re-measured** — and the answer was bigger than the numbers:
   the pairs fall into **three book shapes**, only one of which is repairable.
3. **`19Khu02 → 28KhuA09`, 350 links.** It mixes shapes A and B; the `tail()`
   guard is the only reason 101 correct links were not moved off the commentary.
4. **Shape C decided: leave as printed.** ~3,000 links closed as *not a defect*.
5. **`mark_condemned.py --verify` was found dead** — crashing, not passing, since
   `verdict` was introduced. No gate ran it.
6. **The silence measured**, and it is not silence: about a third of the
   "uncommented" verses are glossed collectively. **This corrected a claim I had
   made the same morning.**
7. **Section names extracted and written** — `19Khu02` 3 distinct → 444,
   `28KhuA09` 1 → 47, both gated red first and read off printed pages.

**Two of the day's largest findings came from an instrument being wrong, not
from the work planned.** When a measure and a reading disagreed, the reading won
every time.

>   `check_apd_gear.js` all green, `check_search.js` all green,
>   `check_lookup_reach.js` 12/0.
> * **v2.8.0 is released and deposited**, its DOI read from the record and in
>   `CITATION.cff` (commit `96e1eb0e8`). The niggahita display toggle — edition

## 1. ~~Two commands, then you are done for the day~~ — done, 2026-08-09

```bash
cd ~/Documents/OSBCT
rm -f _probe_band_verse.js      # my jsdom probe; the sandbox cannot delete it
./push.sh                       # COMMIT_MSG.bak carries the findings commit
```

That commit changes no text, moves no link, and touches nothing under
`site/` — so there was **no stamp, no Pages run and no R2 sync needed.**
It was the two findings notes plus the corrected handoff.

## 2. Where things stood on 08-09 (superseded by the box above)

**Shipped and clean.** v2.7.0 and v2.7.1 both released, deposited and in the
citation ledger — `10.5281/zenodo.21863987` and `10.5281/zenodo.21864177`, both
read from the record. Live site serves build `92157e0692e0`, verified
cache-busted. R2 fully synced: bucket counts match git, the origin gate is green
at 38/38, and the family store returns 200. Errata register: **49 confirmed, 18
candidate, 1 resolved, of 68.** Gates green — links and concordance "no measure
regressed", search all green, `check_derived --deep` all fresh.

**Nothing is broken and nothing is unshipped.** Everything below is either work
you parked deliberately, or something nobody has looked at yet.

## 3. What to tell a new chat

### 3a. ~~The dictionary gate~~ — **DONE 2026-08-10, UPLOAD CONFIRMED 2026-08-26**

Kept because the account of *why* it was five coupled steps is still the best
description of what a store change costs. All five landed: the new `hw` store
(191,928 keys, largest shard 147,337 B under the 150 kB cap), `lem` untouched,
`check_apd_gear.js` extended and run red first, and the R2 upload — the step
that was owed for thirteen days — now verified against the live origin.
**Only item 5 remains, and it always was separate: the §2/§9 redistribution
question.** What follows is the brief as it was written.

It is not vague, it is **five coupled steps, each with a gate**, and one of them
touches production:

1. The key set roughly **quadruples** — 52,757 → 210,111+ headwords. Sharding,
   the 150 KB byte cap and the gz layer all have to be re-measured, not assumed.
2. The store is **served from Cloudflare R2**, not from Pages. So it needs an
   upload and a `WLV` bump, and until both happen production keeps serving the
   old store while the repo looks fixed. That is the failure mode the DPD family
   rebuild already hit once.
3. `panel.js` needs a new lookup path, and the **APD gear list** must learn the
   new sections.
4. `pipeline/check_apd_gear.js` (27 assertions) must be **extended and made to
   fail on the current build first**.
5. **The licence question gets louder.** These sources sit in `lookup_eval/`
   because redistribution is unresolved (§2, §9). Making 163,453 more headwords
   reachable does not change that, but it does raise the stakes of getting it
   settled — and it must be settled separately, not inside this fix.

Two facts that make it tractable, both verified:

* **The safe design is a NEW store, not a wider `lem`.** Key it on the
  dictionaries' own headwords, leave `lem` and the DPD path untouched, and have
  the panel consult the new store when `lem` misses. Additive, so no existing
  gate can regress.
* **That design needs no GoldenDict.** `_panel/build_eval.py:48` reads
  `GD_DIR`, defaulting to a path that no longer exists — re-running the whole
  eval build would need the GoldenDict folder mounted again. But the two files
  the fix needs, `_dictsrc/pced_full.jsonl.gz` (24 MB) and `_dictsrc/pm12e.csv`
  (42 MB), are **in the folder already**.

**One hazard to state up front: `_dictsrc/` is gitignored** (`.gitignore:183`).
Those sources exist on your machine and nowhere else — not in git, not in the
Zenodo deposit. Do not let a session assume it can re-fetch them.

Paste this:

> 2. Mind the key case: PCED's `acc` is capitalised (`Yathānisinna`) while
>    `panel.js look()` tries the exact key then `toLowerCase()`. Fold on write.
> 3. Measure sharding and the 150 KB cap BEFORE building. The key set roughly

>    current build first — `yathānisinna` must return the book B and book K
>    entries. Show me the failing run before the fix.
> 5. The store is served from R2: the job is not done until `r2_upload.sh` has
>    run and `WLV` is bumped. Say so explicitly when you reach that point.
> 6. Do not touch the §2/§9 redistribution question. It is separate.
>

> 52 occurrences. It is the mirror of the `atappaka` fix at `panel.js:714`.

**The four rules that were earned the hard way on 08-09, and should be said to
any session that starts fresh:**

1. **Never typeset filler Pāḷi**, not even in a sketch. A mockup of this corpus
   is a claim about this corpus. Pull the paragraph.
2. **Render, do not infer.** Line breaks come from `verse/`, not from the `text`
   field; nothing about the reader can be concluded from the source.
3. **Bust the cache when measuring what is live**, or you are measuring the past.
4. **Never key the canon by paragraph number** — see
   `claude/paragraph_numbers_are_not_a_key.md`. It caught me again on 08-09.

## 4. Everything that remains

### Ready to decide — yours, nothing blocks them

* ~~**`none` vs `dim`.**~~ **DECIDED 2026-08-26 by the reader: `dim`.** A dead
  "no commentary" and a condemned "link disputed" both render as the dimmed
  chip. The 3,163 concordance violations land in that style. Not yet
  implemented — and it should still be **rendered and photographed against the
  real reader before it ships**, because the decision was made from a
  description and nothing has ever been drawn. If the two states turn out to be
  indistinguishable in use, that is a fact to bring back, not to absorb.
* **Capping the concordance tooltip.** Seven volume codes for `18Khu01`. Cap at
  three with "+4 more", show a count only, or leave it.
* **The legacy links artifact** `check_derived` flags — loaded by nothing.
  Retire or rebuild.
* **The search heavy half** — per-volume shard split into postings + text. Only
  if common-word searches actually hurt you in use.

### The links — one book at a time

* ~~`19Khu02 → 27KhuA08` first~~ — **DONE 2026-08-26. 437 links moved off the
  reprint and onto the comment**, gated red first, verified on four printed
  pages, 470 uncommented verses deliberately left alone.
  `claude/vimanavatthu_links_moved_to_the_gloss.md`. 16 pairs remain.
* ~~RE-MEASURE THE WORKSHEET~~ — **DONE 2026-08-26.**
  `pipeline/measure_requotation.py` replaces the 08-09 measurement, and the
  worksheet is rewritten. **21,621 direct links, 7,437 on a bare reprint, 3,369
  movable.** The important result is not the count but that the pairs fall into
  **three shapes**, not one:
  * **A** — reprint and comment in separate paragraphs under the same number.
    Repairable, and what 27KhuA08 was. `28KhuA09` 348, `40KhuA21` 765,
    `39KhuA20` 590, `34KhuA15` 511, `38KhuA19` 310.
  * **B** — reprint and comment in the SAME paragraph. Nothing to move.
  * **C** — verses run in a block, the comment is collective and **unnumbered**.
    `42KhuA23` 1103, `30KhuA11` 887, `41KhuA22` 528, `31KhuA12` 433,
    `29KhuA10` 67. **DECIDED 2026-08-26: LEAVE AS IT IS** — "if in the PDF is
    like this, keep it as it is". ~3,000 links closed as *not a defect*.
    Imposing a structure the edition does not print would be principle 3
    reaching the link layer.
* ~~Next: `19Khu02 → 28KhuA09`~~ — **DONE 2026-08-26. 350 links moved**, gated
  red first, printed pages 7, 161 and 191. It **mixes shapes A and B**: 101 of
  its links already landed on a paragraph that reprints *and then comments*, and
  the `tail()` guard is the only reason they were not moved off the commentary.
  A repair script right for one book is not thereby right for the next.
* Next in this line: the three big Jātaka pairs — `40KhuA21` 765 movable,
  `39KhuA20` 590, `38KhuA19` 310 — and `34KhuA15` 511 (Buddhavaṁsa). Check for
  the shape-B mixture in each before applying, as 28KhuA09 required.
* **The shadowing defect FIRST** within the placer work: it moves links off
  paragraphs the edition addressed *by number*, which is the strongest evidence
  there is.
* Then: the three placer recommendations (blocking 20Khu03 vaggas 2–42, computed
  in `_xc/linksk_toc/`), the three inversions (vaggas 18, 34, 35), the
  printed-page spot check `_xc/hy2/20Khu03_vaggas2-42_dryrun.md`, the
  concordance gate when vaggas 2–42 land.
* A printed-page ground-truth sample and provenance tiers in the UI are what
  turn "accurate" into a number.

### Measured, not repaired

* **5,616 CANON PARAGRAPHS ANSWER TO THE PREVIOUS BOOK'S SECTION NAME**, in 44
  volumes — found 2026-08-26. A book's opening paragraphs often carry no `sutta`
  field, and the name was being carried forward across the boundary: all 340
  paragraphs from the start of Petavatthu in `19Khu02` to its first section were
  labelled with a *Vimānavatthu* section. Worst: 19Khu02 678, 01Vin01 399,
  28KhuA09 397, 02ViT02 318, 26VsmT02 299, 25Khu08 295.
  `check_links.py:name_at` now stops at a book boundary — which moved name-match
  from "76.126% of 20,784" to **"76.442% of 16,657", i.e. 4,127 comparisons
  (19.9%) had been made against a name from the wrong book** — but that only
  stops it being *measured*. **The reader still shows those paragraphs under the
  wrong heading.**
  **DIAGNOSED 2026-08-26: it is not a fallback question, it is MISSING DATA.**
  The edition prints a section name there — p.143 of `19Khu02` prints
  `1. Khettūpamapetavatthu` above ¶1 of the Petavatthu, and the corpus has
  nothing. `pipeline/extract_sections.py` reads them from `pali-unicode/`:
  **4,279 printed headings over the 40 canon volumes, 1,301 absent from the
  corpus**, and on `19Khu02` — 3,660 paragraphs carrying **3** section names —
  it finds 501 and resolves **501/501 in order, 0 backwards, 0 unresolvable**.
  **Nothing has been written.** 1,301 is a FLOOR: the extractor is blind in
  20Khu03, 29Abhi01 and 36–40Abhi, which is a fault in the instrument, not
  evidence the edition prints no sections there.
  **APPLIED 2026-08-26 to `19Khu02` (476 names, 3 distinct → 444) and
  `28KhuA09` (51 names, 1 → 47), both gated red first and verified on printed
  pages.** `name-match` went 76.442 → 76.141 (canon side only, half-applied) →
  **76.670** once the commentary side followed — more pairs checkable *and* more
  agreeing, which is the shape a real repair makes.
  ~~**`27KhuA08` REFUSES**: body 83, Mātikā 79.~~ **RESOLVED AND WRITTEN
  2026-09-05: 84 names, distinct 0 → 83.** All four "extras"
  are printed in the Mātikā; the front-matter reader was dropping them, for two
  independent reasons — a run-length heuristic that the printed list's own page
  feet and vagga lines interrupt, and `NUM` not matching the range-numbered
  `8-9. Niddā-suniddāvimānavaṇṇanā`, which also hid that section from the BODY
  scan. Had the Mātikā gate merely counted instead of refusing, those nine
  paragraphs would have shipped under `Uposathāvimānavaṇṇanā`. §8a.
  **115 volumes untouched.** The canon reader is blind in 20Khu03, 29Abhi01 and
  36–40Abhi; the commentary reader has been tried on exactly two volumes.
  Still open: the vagga at ord 483 (`'Itthivimāna      4. Mañjiṭṭhakavagga'`,
  two headings glued), and the three headings stored as numbered paragraphs.
  `claude/sections_the_edition_prints.md` §7–8.
* **The unnumbered-siglum class.** 2,535 paragraphs in 76 volumes carry a `*`,
  `+`, `x` or `( )` mark; **1,427 have no apparatus entry at all.** Two known
  defects: the `+` note absent from `10Ma02.app.json` ¶296, and unnumbered notes
  glued onto numbered ones. `_review/sigla_report.json`.
* **The verse branch for band blocks** (`asSpine`). Confirmed by rendering.
  Needs care: `hide/` maps assume the branch runs, and on 20KhuA01 ten hidden
  ordinals are merge-absorbed into neighbours' verse entries.
* **The hyphen family's remainder** — the consonant branch (1,521, ca-saddo
  class, unadjudicated), `extract.py:204` hygiene, and the undrawn bold spans:
  **remeasure before believing the old ~17%.**
* **18 register candidates**, plus the per-entry audit of the 22 other-layer
  entries. The PDF correction itself (ToUnicode injection, one volume first)
  stays on standby by your decision.

### The reader — found 2026-09-05

* ~~**Columns view put the canon under the Aṭṭhakathā heading.**~~ **FIXED**,
  gated by `pipeline/check_columns.js`. Kept here because the shape of the
  report matters: the reader said "P should be on the left", and **the column
  order was never wrong**. Acting on the report as phrased would have moved the
  headings away from the columns. `claude/the_columns_were_never_out_of_order.md`.
* ~~**Open, and it needs a browser: does row hover work in Columns at all?**~~
  **ANSWERED BY THE READER 2026-09-05 — it did not, and now does.** `.rowline`
  is `display:contents`, generates no box, and the handlers were on it, so
  `mouseenter` never fired. It survived because `.para:hover .tools` is pure CSS
  on a real box: the buttons appeared, so the row looked alive, while the half
  that says *which commentary belongs to this verse* was dead. Handlers moved to
  `.cell`. **The gate proves the wiring and cannot prove the pointer** — jsdom
  has no hit-testing, which is exactly the half that was broken. Instrument for
  the wiring, reader for the pointer; this one needed both.
* **AND THEN THE GATE WENT GREEN WHILE THE FEATURE STAYED INVISIBLE.** The
  reader looked again and said "only one lights", unchanged. Measured in a real
  browser: the row DID go hot and both paragraphs took the highlight — but
  `--hover` is **15 levels out of 255** from the page in dark, so the only
  visible change was the toolbar, which is on one paragraph. Now `--active` with
  a `--faint` outline. **A gate on "does the class get applied" is not a gate on
  the feature**; `check_columns.js` now asserts a minimum token contrast in both
  palettes, threshold derived from the rejected and accepted values, negative
  control run. Three rounds on this one defect, the instrument wrong differently
  each time, and a reader right every time.
* **`check_fn_markers.js` OOMs at node's default heap** and passes at
  `--max-old-space-size=6144`. Pre-existing (it never renders the columns
  branch). Either raise it in the script or say so where the gates are listed —
  right now it looks like a failure.
* **`site/reader/sections/` is stale for all three volumes that got section
  names** — `19Khu02`, `28KhuA09`, `27KhuA08`. Advisory, not blocking. The ☰
  Contents is built by `buildOutline` from `c.headings`, NOT from the `sutta`
  field, so the Contents does not yet list those sections even though the
  citation and title bar do.

### One property of the tooling, recorded so it does not mislead twice

* **`stamp_build.py` IS NOT IDEMPOTENT, and a dry run is not a verification.**
  BUILD is a hash over the 2,086 JSON files under `site/` — and `site/build.json`
  is one of them. So writing the stamp changes the input to the next stamp: after
  `--write` produced `8196f1a01c65`, an immediate dry run reported the tree
  hashing to `2798a6a45568`. **Nothing was wrong.** Do not re-run `--write` "to
  be safe": it produces a spurious new build and dirties a clean tree. And do not
  use a dry run to check that the live stamp matches the tree — it cannot.
  Verify a deploy by fetching `build.json` cache-busted and comparing it to
  `site/build.json`, which is what the committed stamp actually says.

### Never looked at

* **397 note numbers have no marker anywhere in their paragraph** — 0.9% of
  44,917. Either the keying or the extraction is off by a paragraph.
* **The marker→note pairing is unestablished for a third of the corpus** —
  23,099 of 69,000. Closing it means keying notes to the marker's OFFSET.
* **The verse map re-segments markers away from the paragraph text** — 27Khu10
  reports 494 against 564 *the other way*. A question about `verse/`.
* **X007**, now suspect for the same stale-snapshot reason as the nine
  withdrawn. Check it against the live PDF before asking about it again.
* **`corpus/*.errata.json` still feeds the review sheet** — refresh the snapshot
  or have `build_glyph_review.py` read the served text, or the next sheet
  re-raises the nine withdrawn sites.

### Housekeeping

* Nine kintipañha heads still tail-of-paragraph; BLOCKBREAK off; `position`
  unmeasured for 114 of 118 volumes; the WLV gate; the offline package (§2
  permission first); `.gitignore`'s stale store rule.
* **Three gate gaps.** `check_r2_origin.js` cannot tell "reachable and absent"
  from "unreachable" — its negative control passes when the network is down —
  and it covers neither `lookup_eval/family/` nor `form/`. The shape of a real
  404 from that bucket is now known (empty body, no `Content-Type`, unlike a
  present object's `application/gzip`), so the discrimination is cheap to add.
* **And the third, found 2026-08-26: nothing checks that the reverse link maps
  are derivable from the forward ones.** They had drifted again — `32KhuA13`
  was missing 33 entries, and `28KhuA09`/`41KhuA22` had six entries attributed
  to the wrong canon paragraph — all of it predating this session's work and
  none of it noticed by any gate. Rebuilt and now consistent, but the same
  silence will return after the next link repair that forgets `build_rev.py`.
  §7b of `claude/vimanavatthu_links_moved_to_the_gloss.md`.
* `v2.7.0` is a lightweight tag where v2.4.0–v2.6.0 are annotated. It has a DOI.
  **Leave it**; recorded so nobody rediscovers it as a defect.
